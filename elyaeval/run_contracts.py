"""
Typed return contracts for run_app(), one per task family.

Every generated test template needs run_app() to return a specific shape —
today that shape is only documented as a docstring comment inside each
.tmpl file. This module makes each shape a real, importable type instead,
so:
  - it's self-documenting (hover/go-to-definition instead of scrolling to
    a comment)
  - it's a single source of truth — change a field once here, not once per
    template that happens to mention it
  - mistakes (wrong order, missing field) surface immediately instead of
    failing later inside LLMTestCase construction

Add a new NamedTuple here whenever a new task family gets its own template.
